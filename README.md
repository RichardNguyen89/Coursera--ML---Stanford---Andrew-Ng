# ML by Coursera&Stanford-Andrew-Ng

My attempt to complete the Machine Learning course on Coursera by Stanford University. Offered by Andrew Ng.
The course introduces the concept of machine learning and different modelling techniques: regression (linear and logistics), random forest, support vector machine, neural network.
It also teaches machine learning model components such as different cost functions, activation functions and so on.
